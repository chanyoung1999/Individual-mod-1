# Overview



This was the very first code I've been working on for the healthbar of the game I'm developing. It is meant to allow the health bar to function with a filler that would decrease and increase whether a player is taking a damage from the enemy or waiting to regenerate.

# Development Environment


I was using Visual Code Studio to complete this C# programming.

# Future Work

- I need to figure out what is causing the program to crash when it is being merged with the unity
- I am planning on applying more features such as the gradiant which would allow the filler of the program to change its color
